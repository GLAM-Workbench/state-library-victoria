    "# Download an image using the IIIF server and a Handle url\n",
    "\n",
    "[IIIF](https://iiif.io/) (the International Image Interoperability Framework) has defined a set of standards for publishing and using image collections. The State Library of Victoria makes many of its images available from an IIIF-compliant server. This means you can access and manipulate the images in standard ways set out by the [IIIF Image API](https://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Many images in the State Library's collection also have a permanent url, created using the Handle system. These are displayed in Trove. But there's no obvious way of getting an IIIF image from a Handle. Of course, if you're a human you can load the image page in your browser and click on the download button. But what if you want to build a processing pipeline, or create a dataset of images? Wouldn't it be good if you could just supply a Handle url and get back an image in whatever format or size you wanted? That's what this notebook does.\n",
    "\n",
    "One odd thing I discovered when developing this notebook is that if you try to download an image from the IIIF server using the `@id` in the image manifest, you get a 403 ('Forbidden') error. This seems to be because the server is expecting a session cookie in the request headers. In order to set this cookie, you have to first download the image manifest itself and submit the saved cookie with the image request (fortunately `requests.Session()` makes this easy)."
